### Project Brief

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo, Express and Node** to build an API and a **Angular front-end app** that consumes it
* **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those model
* **API must include tests for the authentication and resful routes
* **Consume your own API** by making your front-end app with **Angular** using some 3rd party dependencies such as **ui.router** and **ng-resource**
* **Add authentication to your API** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible
* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A Anguar front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file**
